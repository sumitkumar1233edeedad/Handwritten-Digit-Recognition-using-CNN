# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

A deep learning project that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset containing thousands of handwritten digit images.

## 📌 Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a computer vision problem where a machine learns to identify digits written by humans.  
This project builds a CNN model that takes an image as input and predicts the digit (0–9).
